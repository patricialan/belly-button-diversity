# Belly Button Diversity

## Project Overview
Test subjects had their navels swabbed to discover what bacterial species were present. See <[samples.json](samples.json)> for the raw data. A dynamic web application was created to allow subjects to view their results online. The application features a dropdown menu of anonymized ID numbers. Selection of a number triggers a display of demographic information and visualizations. Visualizations show the most numerous (top ten) bacterial species, all bacterial species, and frequency of belly button washing for the individual.  

See <https://patricialan.github.io/belly-button-diversity/> to view the web application.
